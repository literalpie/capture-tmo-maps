# capture-tmo-maps
a simple node script that automatically captures screenshots of the T-Mobile coverage map

This is the script that I use to capture map screenshots for http://www.literalpie.com/#/tmo-maps/us.
To use it, clone this repo, run `npm install`, and then run `npm run capture-maps`.
Node is required.
